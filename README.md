# Fraud Detection Using Machine Learning

## Overview

This project focuses on detecting fraudulent transactions using machine learning techniques. Fraud detection is a critical application in various industries, especially in financial services, where the ability to accurately identify fraudulent activities can prevent significant monetary losses.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation using various machine learning algorithms.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) dataset from Kaggle. It contains transactions made by credit cards in September 2013 by European cardholders.

**Features:**
- **V1, V2, ..., V28:** The result of a PCA transformation; these are the only features that are provided.
- **Amount:** The transaction amount.
- **Time:** The seconds elapsed between this transaction and the first transaction in the dataset.
- **Class:** The label where 1 indicates fraud and 0 indicates non-fraud.

*Note: Make sure to download the dataset and place it in the `data/` directory before running the project.*

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fraud-detection-ml.git
   cd fraud-detection-ml
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in fraud detection due to the imbalanced nature of the dataset (only a small percentage of transactions are fraudulent). The following preprocessing steps are applied:

- **Handling Missing Values:** The dataset is checked for missing values and cleaned accordingly.
- **Scaling Features:** Features like `Amount` and `Time` are scaled using standardization techniques.
- **Handling Imbalanced Data:** Techniques such as **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** or **undersampling** are applied to balance the dataset.
- **Feature Engineering:** Potentially creating new features that might enhance model performance.

## Modeling

Several machine learning algorithms are applied and compared for fraud detection, including:

- **Logistic Regression:** A linear model used as a baseline.
- **Random Forest:** An ensemble model that combines multiple decision trees.
- **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost):** A powerful boosting algorithm for handling imbalanced datasets.
- **Neural Networks:** A simple feedforward neural network is also trained for comparison.

The models are trained using cross-validation to ensure generalization and avoid overfitting.

## Evaluation

The models are evaluated using various metrics to handle the imbalanced nature of the data:

- **Confusion Matrix:** To visualize the performance of the model.
- **Precision, Recall, F1-Score:** To measure the model's effectiveness in identifying fraudulent transactions.
- **ROC-AUC Curve:** To evaluate the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.

## Results

- The best model achieved a precision of **X%**, a recall of **Y%**, and an F1-score of **Z%**.
- The **ROC-AUC** score for the top-performing model was **W**.

*Note: Replace **X%**, **Y%**, **Z%**, and **W** with the actual results from your model.*
